This thesis was written to complete my studies in applied informatics. 
Eventhough I did not have any knowledge of quantum computing I found it really interesting and wanted to know if quantum computing could have real benefits outside the research domain.
After doing the study I found out that businesses could really gain from it. But, at this moment the technology is not developped enough to have real advantages.
This also made me realised i might want to go further in this discipline and make a career in it. Because i do think that with some more advanced research this could change the world.


This would not have been possible without the help of others.
I would like to thank Antonia Pierreux and Robbe Coudenys, they helped me with the stucture and the proofreading of this paper.
Then i would like to thank Cathy Lecoutre for proofreading this thesis.
I would like to thank Florian Unseld and Pablo Cova Fari√±a for giving me insights and recommendations on books to read about this topic.
Lastly i would like to thank my girlfriend, friends and parents to support me throughout my studies, it would not have been possible without them.
